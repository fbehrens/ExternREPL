Hi,

I have changed the default mapping of running selection `current Line`
form CTRL+Shift + ENTER
to   Alt        + ENTER.

The reason for this, that Visual Studio has same key for F# Interactive Window.

If you want to keep the old key,
add

  { "caption": "ExternalREPL: current line",
       "keys": ["ctrl+shift+enter"],"command": "extern_repl_ops" ,"args": {"what": "line"}},

to your keymap.
