Hi,

I am cleaning up a little and the current `last repl command `
form CTRL + up
to   CTRL-SHIFT+s\.

The reason for this, that CTRL-up is the default key for mission control on OSX.

add

  { "keys": ["ctrl+up"],"command": "extern_repl_up" }, //last repl command

to your User/default.sublime-keymap
to keep the old behaviour.
